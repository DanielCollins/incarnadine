== Windows ==

Prerequisites
-------------

	* CMake for Windows (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
	* A working compiler that CMake supports (e.g. Visual Studio, MinGW, etc)
	* OpenGL libraries for your system (should be bundled with compiler?)
	* SDL development libraries (http://www.libsdl.org)


Generating project files (Command-line with MSYS)
-------------------------------------------------

The following commands will create the appropriate files for your compiler/IDE (assuming you're
in the top-level incarnadine-engine directory):

cmake -D "SDLMAIN_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=</path/to/sdl-devel-libs>/lib/SDLmain.lib"
      -D "SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP:FILEPATH=</path/to/sdl-devel-libs>/lib/SDL.lib"
      -D "SDL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=</path/to/sdl-devel-libs>/include"
      -G "<generator-name>" .

</path/to/sdl-devel-libs> is the path where you extracted the SDL development libraries to.
It should have the 'lib' and 'include' subdirectories contained within it.

<generator-name> is the name of your compiler/IDE. Type 'cmake --help' for a list of supported
generators for your platform.


Generating project files (GUI with cmake-gui)
---------------------------------------------

The CMake GUI is an easy way to generate files that your compiler can work with.

1. Open CMake GUI.
2. Set the source code directory to the 'incarnadine-engine' top level directory (i.e. the first
   folder you find that contains a 'CMakeLists.txt' file).
3. Set the build directory to the same as above.
4. Add Entry: SDLMAIN_LIBRARY:FILEPATH:</path/to/sdl-devel-libs>/lib/SDLmain.lib
5. Add Entry: SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP:FILEPATH:</path/to/sdl-devel-libs>/lib/SDL.lib
6. Add Entry: SDL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH:</path/to/sdl-devel-libs>/include
7. Press Configure.
8. Choose your generator and press Finish.
9. If there are still values in red, but no error occurred, press Configure again.
10. Press Generate to create the project files for the selected compiler/IDE.

FIXME: When you want to run the test program, you'll need to
       copy '</path/to/sdl-devel-libs>/lib/SDL.dll' to the directory from which the
       executable is run.
